                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>Forever Beats was a commercially available groove box for iOS. It featured an FM powered sound engine
                    that could produce percussive and melodic sounds in six distinctive mono voices. The sounds were
                    controlled with an in-built sequencer. It was also capable of sequencing external hardware. It is
                    best understood as an Elektron Model:Cycles for iPad with a touch screen and additional beat
                    shuffling options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app was well received by users at the time and had a 4.5 rating on the App Store.

                <h3>Technical Overview

                </h3>
                <p>The project was largely implemented in the Swift programming language. The sound engine was
                    implemented in pure data using the pd-for-ios library, which communicated with the rest of the
                    program through an Objective-C bridge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sound engine featured 6 synthesised voices, 4 of which were fairly standard synthesised drums
                    sounds. The other two voices were designed by <a
                        href="https://mfl.floatingspectrum.com/portfolio/">Mei-Fang Liau</a> and were capable of a broad
                    range of
                    textural and melodic sounds. The sequencer featured a custom beat shuffling option, allowing the
                    user to algorithmically generate beat variations during live performance.
