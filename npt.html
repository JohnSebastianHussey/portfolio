                        <h3>Project Description</h3>
                        <p>The noise, pulse, tone generator is a sound source that partially implements trainlet
                            synthesis as
                            described in <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262681544/microsound/">Microsound by
                                Curtis
                                Roads</a>. It is deployed as a VST plugin to be used inside
                            host environments such as Ableton and Bitwig.

                        <h3>Features and Functionality
                        </h3>
                        <p>At its core the plugin is an impulse generator. The trainlet synthesiser focuses on pulse
                            density,
                            timbre and spatialization parameters. Incoming MIDI notes trigger an envelope which is
                            applied to
                            the amplitude of the trainlet output, initiating a pulse train at the pitch specified by the
                            pitch
                            parameter. Spatial position is primarily controlled by a pan parameter. Some degree of
                            randomisation
                            can be introduced with the stereo spread parameter, allowing for each pulse to have its own
                            position
                            in the stereo field. Pulse rate is controlled (amongst other things) by a macro parameter.
                            Timbral
                            variety is achieved with an additive synthesis approach coupled with a set of 3 window
                            functions,
                            which the user can smoothly morph between, with one parameter.

                        </p>
                        <p>In one deviation from the trainlet synthesis approach described in Microsound, the user is
                            offered 3
                            core app states, noise, pulse trains and whole tones, which are navigated with the macro
                            parameter.
                            The noise is created by dense, frequency modulated pulse trains and the whole tones are
                            created by
                            pulse
                            trains that have a zero or small duration between each pulse, so that the pulse train is
                            experienced
                            as a continuous tone. This is a shortcut to offering a larger sonic palette.

                        <h3>Technical Overview

                        </h3>
                        <p>The app is implemented in the JUCE framework allowing different systems to be easily
                            targeted. The UI
                            is
                            implemented using the JUCE draw routines and a set of custom classes that act as a design
                            system.

                        </p>
                        <p>DSP code is implemented in C++ in a separate custom package. Each DSP unit (for example
                            envelope, pan
                            function or oscillator) is broken down into its own class for maximum portability and
                            transparency.
                            This
                            approach was influenced by the <a
                                href="https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack/blob/master/plaits/dsp/oscillator/sine_oscillator.h">Mutable
                                Instruments Plaits project</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In terms of voicing, there are 4 trainlet voices that typically play back simultaneously but
                            pulse
                            duration can be randomly offset to create a denser and more chaotic timbres. Each voice is
                            implemented
                            as a digitally controlled oscillator that uses a pre-calculated wavetable to
                            generate a pulse with the appropriate harmonic content. Each pulse consists of a fundamental
                            with 14
                            additional harmonics. The relative influence of the harmonics is determined by a parameter
                            and a
                            window
                            function is applied to each pulse for additional timbral control. Linear interpolation
                            is used on the wavetable to minimise artefacts during playback.
